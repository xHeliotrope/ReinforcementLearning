## Wavelets
Wavelets are like waves, but they are zero most of the place. 

Think this:

instead of this:

Wavelets are a core part of digital signal processing, and understanding how to construct wavelets, and use their associated functions (discrete wavelet transforms). 
If you are acquainted with Fourier Transforms, Wavelet Transforms are similar, in both how they act on inputs and what they can do to signals. One of the key differences is that wavelets provide spatial information.

In particular, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposes a signal into a set of mutually orthogonal _wavelet_ basis _functions_.
